## Snake_game_assembly-MASM-
I made snake game in assembly language through  interrupt functions and video mode.

All code is in hm.asm file
Other files are requred to run masm in DosBox

# How to launch 

1. Go to DosBox
2. Enter mount c: ~/ASM (go to the folder)
3. Then enter c:
4. masm /a hm.asm
5. link hm
6. hm

Also you can debug through turbo debugger comand (after step 5)
td hm
